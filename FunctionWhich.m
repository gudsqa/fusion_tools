function executable = FunctionWhich(command)
% FunctionWhich attempts to find the location of the provided command. 
% This function is part of the fusion_tools submodule, and is called by the
% other functions to determine how to execute plastimatch.  The command is
% first searched for in the system path; if not found, the function will
% successively search through each path provided in the paths variable 
% until it is found. 
%
% This function is compatible with linux, MacOS, and Windows 7 and later 
% operating systems. Plastimatch is Copyrighted by The General Hospital 
% Corporation and is available at http://plastimatch.org.
%
% The following variables are required for proper execution: 
%
%   command:    string containing the command to be executed (plastimatch)
%
% The following variables are returned upon successful completion:
%
%   executable: string containing the path and command name to the command.
%               If the function was not found, this string will be empty.
%
% Below is an example of how this function is used:
%  
%   % Search for the function 'plastimatch'
%   executable = FunctionWhich('plastimatch');
%
%   % If found, use it to execute a registration
%   if ~isempty(executable) {
%       system([executable, ' register commandfile']);
%   }
